# Shopping Cart

A shopping cart with a promo section that accepts valid codes which inturn changes the price. The motivation behind this was to gain experience in implementing Redux into a React app.

Current discount codes:

'DISCOUNT' - this will give you 10% off the item.

See the live version [here](https://shoppingcart-demo.netlify.app/)

## Future additions

1. A choice of multiple items.
2. A wider selection of discount codes.
3. A landing page to select items before checkout.
4. Styling (possibly last after all functionality)
